# KuCoin Community Chain

## Introduction
KuCoin Community Chain (KCC) is a high-performance and decentralized public chain built by fans of KCS and KuCoin.  

Developed based on EVM compatible with the purpose of providing community users with a higher-speed,
convenient and low-cost blockchain user experience.

KuCoin Community Chain (KCC) will have the following characteristics:
- Fully compatible with EVM and ERC-20 smart contracts, with extremely low migration costs
- KuCoin Token (KCS) will serve as the only core fuel and native token for KCC and can be used in scenarios such as gas fee payment
- A block every 3 seconds results in faster transaction confirmation and higher chain performance
- Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus algorithm, high efficiency, security and stability

## Mission

Mission: To accelerate the flow of value around the world without boundaries.

## Risk statement

- Before any operations in the fields related to cryptocurrency or DeFi, please first do your own research.
- All users and developers can build the dApp in KCC testnet then the mainnet in the follow-up for free.
- Please distinguish the test environment (the testnet) from the main network environment (the mainnet). The assets generated in the test environment do not have value, so please be careful against the cryptocurrency fraud.
- KCC will announce authorization, promotion and other cooperation through its official social network, please kindly check the official information and avoid phishing sites.
- Please make sure that you are visiting the official website to avoid the loss of private key.

### Steps
```
git clone -b kcc --single-branch https://github.com/kucoin-community-chain/kcc.git
cd kcc
make geth
```
### Running
The command line flags are similar to go-ethereum, you can use `./build/bin/geth --help` for all command line options,
like `./build/bin/geth --testnet` to join the Testnet. Caution: Use the specific "geth" version located at `./build/bin/geth`.

## Docker

You can use [https://hub.docker.com/r/kucoincommunitychain/kcc](https://hub.docker.com/r/kucoincommunitychain/kcc) to fast deploy and test.

## Consensus
KCC introduces a PoSA consensus mechanism, which features low transaction costs, low transaction delay,
high transaction concurrency, and supports up to 29 validators.

PoSA is a combination of PoA and PoS. To become a validator, you need to submit a proposal first and wait for other active validators to vote on it. After more than half of them voted, you will be eligible to become a validator. Any address can stake to an address that qualifies to become a validator, and after the validator's staking volume ranks in the top 29, it will become an active validator in the next epoch.

All active validators are ordered according to predefined rules and take turns to mine blocks. If a validator fails to mine a block on time during their own round, the active validators who have not been involved in the past n/2 (n is the number of active validators) blocks will randomly perform the block-out. At least n/2+1 active validators work properly to ensure the proper operation of the blockchain.

The difficulty value of a block is 2 when the block is generated normally and 1 when the block is not generated in a predefined order. When a fork of the blockchain occurs, the blockchain selects the corresponding fork according to the cumulative maximum difficulty.

### System Contracts
KCC has made 3 built-in contracts for PoSA in the genesis file.

The source code of those contracts are forked from Heco, you can locate them here: [https://github.com/kucoin-community-chain/kcc-genesis-contracts](https://github.com/kucoin-community-chain/kcc-genesis-contracts)。

The management of the current validators are all done by the system contracts.

- Proposal Responsible for managing access to validators and managing validator proposals and votes.
- Validators Responsible for ranking management of validators, staking and unstaking operations, distribution of block rewards, etc.
- Punish Responsible for punishing operations against active validators who are not working properly.

Blockchain call system contracts：

- At the end of each block, the Validators contract is called and the fees for all transactions in the block are distributed to active validators.
- The Punish contract is called to punish the validator when the validator is not working properly.
- At the end of each epoch, the Validators contract is called to update active validators, based on the ranking.

### stake
You can call the `stake` method in the `validator` contract to stake for any validator, the minimum staking amount for each validator is 32KCS.

### unstake
If you want to `unstake` your KCS, you need to call the `unstake` method in the `validator` contract,
and wait for 86400 blocks(3 days), then call the `withdrawStaking` method in the `validator` contract to make the amount available.

### punish
Whenever a validator is found not to mine a block as predefined, the Punish contract is automatically called at the end of this block and the validator is counted. When the count reaches 24, all income of the validator is punished. When the count reaches 48, the validator is removed from the list of active validators, and the validator is disqualified.

## FAQ
1.What is the consensus mechanism of KCC?
KCC adopts the PoSA consensus mechanism, featuring with low cost, high performance and stable block generation, supporting up to 29 validator nodes;

2.How to become a KCC validator node?
To become a validator, you need to create a node and submit a proposal, and wait for other active validators to vote. After receiving more than half of the votes, you are eligible to become a validator. Any address can stake the address that is eligible to become a validator. After the validator's staked amount ranks in the top 29, the validator will become an active one in the next epoch.

3.Does KCC support EVM?
KCC fully supports EVM and is completely friendly to Ethereum developers.

4.What SDK does KCC use?
KCC is highly compatible with Ethereum, so we adopt the sdk of Ethereum such as web3js, web3j, etc.

5.I want to carry out some operations and tests on the KCC testnet. Where can I get test tokens?
You can visit our testnet faucet: https://faucet-testnet.kcc.network.

6.How to stake contract nodes?
Users can call the stake method of the validator contract to stake any node. The minimum staked amount for each validator is 32 KCS.

7.How to unlock the staked amount?
If users want to retrieve the staked KCS, they need to call the unstake method of the validators contract to unlock the staked amount. After 86,400 blocks were generated (3 days), call the withdrawStaking method of the validators contract to get the staked KCS back.

8.Get stuck when using MetaMask (including but not limited to transfer stuck or delay, problem of data display, etc.)
Use the plug-in expand view to display at full screen, which can be more stable or choose "Accelerate" to increase gaslimt and gasPrice.

### How to configure MetaMask Wallet
